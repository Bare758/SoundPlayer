SoundPlayer Manual

Welcome to my Soundplayer Program.

This program provides multiple audio sounds for listeners. I have created two buttons and they provide two different sounds. If you press the first button you will hear “I feel good” by the late great James Brown. If you press the second button you will hear “Hello Baby” from the late great Frank Sinatra. 

This program was written in Java. 


Sincerely, Mr Bare
